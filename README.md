# EDA_TMDb_movie_data
This Repo could be used as a template to conduct Exploratoy Data Analysis. I put in my code as well as the Tips for further usage.
There are 4 main parts:
1. Introduction to the Dataset: overview of the dataset and stated the questions for Analysis
2. Data Wrangling: Explore and define data issues, followed by Data Cleaning process
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Compute the relevant statistics throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data
4. Conclusions: Summarize your findings and the results that have been performed in relation to the questions provided at the beginning of the analysis


### Dataset Description 

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.

The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.


### Questions for Analysis
**Genres insights**: 
1. Which genres are most popular from year to year?
2. Which genre experienced the most evolution throughout the period 1960-2015?
3. Which genre generates the most revenue & profit for the whole period 1960-2015?

**Revenue insights**: What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
